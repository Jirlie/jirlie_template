The administrators will have the right to configure the Services based on your requirements and manage end users in your organization account. If your organization account is created and configured on your behalf by a third party, it is likely that such third party has assumed administrator role for your organization. Make sure that you enter into a suitable agreement with such third party specifying such party’s roles and restrictions as an administrator of your organization account.

<br><br>

<br><br>
In the absence of any specified administrator account recovery process, Neu Ocean may provide control of an administrator account to an individual providing proof satisfactory to Neu Ocean demonstrating authorization to act on behalf of the organization. You agree not to hold Neu Ocean liable for the consequences of any action taken by Neu Ocean in good faith in this regard.
